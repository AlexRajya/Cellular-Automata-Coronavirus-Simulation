# Cellular-Automata-Coronavirus-Simulation
This app was made for my final year project at university. This app implements a novel simulation model incorporating 2D cellular automata to simulate COVID-19 in Germany.

# Install
1. Clone repo / Download folder 
2. Change directory into repo folder
3. run "npm install"
4. run "npm start"
5. view on localhost or provided IP.

# How to use
1. Select a preset or enter custom parameters 
2. Click on the map to add infected then click the "Start" button
3. Or click the "Start Random" button to add random infected
4. The simulation will then run until the pause/refresh buttons are pressed, or the simulation ends
5. To run the simulation again, press refresh then repeat steps 2/3 (Or simply press start random again).
6. Simulation results will be displayed on graphs, the density map and output numerically.
